# css-design-components
A collection of responsive elements for use in building html/css sites

Here are reusable common elements. Everything is clearly labeled in the index and css files. The css is written so you can just cut and paste the parts corresponding to the component you want. 

Note that the "Minimal Hamburger Menu" uses JS to open and close itself. The code for that is in the <script> at the bottom of the index.html, labeled Mobile Menu Slide Out.
